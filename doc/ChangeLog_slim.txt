1.4.2 - 2018.03.22
	* Added the following statement into THEMES file:
	    As of v1.4.2, presence of background imagefile within a theme directory is optional.
	    Similarly, presence of panel imagefile is optional. Testing has indicated that,
	    by omitting the imagefiles and/or choosing "background_style solidcolor",
	    you may reduce the runtime memory footprint of SliM.
	    NOTE: in the absence of a panel image, the username/login fields are rendered
	    atop a generic (opaque white) rectangular overlay.
	* Removed confusingly redundant "hidecursor" option and renamed
	  the underlying fn App:HideMouseCursor() which is now performed
	  unconditionally ~~ mouse cursor is always hidden during login.
	  The separate textcursor hiding behavior is implicitly false;
	  can be overridden via theme declaration "input_hidecursor true"
	* do not fail (exit) if background image is missing; instead,
	    fallback to using solidcolor
	* do not fail (exit) if panel image is missing; instead,
	    fallback to using a plain, solid color box
	* When solidcolor has been specified, and background_color contains
	    an invalid value (or is empty), assert background_color=#ff0000
	    to provide visual feedback regarding the misconfiguration.
	* added UTF8 support for welcome_message
	    (translations followup needed)
	* debian/rules: add hardening rules
        (source fortification, stack protection, relro)
	* remove unused jpeg.c and png.c, and refs within CMakeLists.txt
        Their functionality had already been incorporated into image.cpp
    * upon failed login (incorrect username+pw), display an onscreen
        message (configurable, via themfile) and, conditionally,
        alert user to CapsLock=ON status
	* fix: "-h" help commandline option showed no ouptut
	* app.cpp:  Fix env alloc (ref http://bugs.debian.org/733916)
	* image.cpp, image.h: outcomment unused fn Merge_non_crop()
	* add new options to support centering of input box text and hiding of cursor
	* rename the generic value "color" (background_style option value) to "solidcolor"
	* fix: save root window pixmap id when setting background
	* antiX/slim.theme: correct option name (input_fgcolor >>> input_color)
	* fix Cfg::getIntOption (declare 0 as default value)
	* upon failed login, provide onscreen hint if CapsLock is ON
	* removed executable bit from shipped pam.sample file
	* debian/control: remove stated build dependency (freeglut3-dev)
	* (devnote: temporarily tag, during testing ### for slim v1.4.2)

1.4.1 - 2018.01.18
	* remove unnecessary declared libz (aka zip) dependency
	* debian/rules: add "scrot" as Recommends (for F11 screenshot) and
        "antix-goodies" (provides yad, used by "slim-login" + "antixccslim.sh")
        and "gtkdialog" (used by "antixccslim.sh").
        Also, add "urxvt" to Recommends (it is the configured console_cmd).
        (TODO: specify xterm|urxvt ? remove xterm from Recommends?)
	* antixccslim.sh: insert test for presence of gtkdialog + yad
	* slim-login: insert test for presence of yad
	* optimize existing antiX background.jpg themefile.
        reduce (35kb>>14kb) and decrease gamma + increase saturation
	* provide a minimal (6kb solid black) bgimage for 'default' theme;
        ship additional themes (to demonstrate examples of both single,
        and double, input box layouts)
	* create a COMPREHENSIVE list of config options/descriptions
        (install creates /usr/share/doc/slim/OPTIONS_LIST.txt)
        and add "SEE ALSO: /usr/share/doc/slim directory" into the manpage
	* add "dh-exec" to build deps (115kb installed size)
        so that we can use /usr/share/dh-exec/dh-exec-install-rename
        within the slim.install file
	* add "scrot" (used for screenshot_cmd) as a Recommends in debian/control
	* slim.conf: prepend ### to inline comments, to differentiate from
        lines containing #currently outcommented values
	* "slim-login" (autologin setup) utility: add sanity check
        (test whether a home directory matching the typed username exists)
         and test whether empty username value was submitted
	* suppress useless/misleading "cancel" buttons within yad errmsg dialogs
	* antixslimcc.sh: check that current_theme is "antix" and, if not,
        warn "this background setter utility is effective only when the currently-selected
        SLiM theme (specified in /etc/slim.conf) is: current_theme  antiX"

1.2.5 - 2006.07.24
    * hiding of the cursor is now an option (disabled
      by default) b/c some WMs do not re-initialize the root window cursor
    * The X server is restarted when the user logs out.
      This fixes potential security issues with user-launched
      apps staying attached to the root window after logout.
    * Bug #7432 : Added proper Xauth authentication: the X server
      is started with the -auth option and the user who logs
