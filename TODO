re-add "themes/default/background.jpg"
package a TINY (solid black 1280x1024 jpg)
(the debian installer currently deleted themes/default/ dir anyhow)

The "console" slim.conf option is described as "open a xterm console"
verify this is accurate (and is working)

consider adding htmldocs, in addition to shipping a manpage

app.cpp ~~ ensure error handling in case 'scrot' is not installed
(display error msg to user alerting the absense, or just return?)

(maybe, eventually) investigate the benefit from modding "sessiondir" -handling code, as seen here: https://github.com/bbidulock/slim/commit/059d9c7562fa454ccc8047a0e9a91da111335359

app.cpp, app.h
followup -- cull currently-outcommented unused Merge_non_crop()

investigate how to avoid the necessity of shipping (and maintaining) this extra file: debian/local/Xsession.d/slim.template

v---- ====================== older, mostly inherited notes

1.2.2
-----
- Don't start X server if theme's not found

2.0.x
-----
- restart X server on ctrl-alt-backspace
- enable switching theme on the fly if a set is specified in slim.conf
- text alignment, to allow to center texts of unknown length (e.g. %host)
            ^--- done (AFAIK)(so... test it)
