re-add "themes/default/background.jpg"
package a TINY (solid black 1280x1024 jpg)
(the debian installer currently deleted themes/default/ dir anyhow)



v---- ====================== older, mostly inherited notes

1.2.2
-----
- Don't start X server if theme's not found

2.0.x
-----
- restart X server on ctrl-alt-backspace
- enable switching theme on the fly if a set is specified in slim.conf
- text alignment, to allow to center texts of unknown length (e.g. %host)
            ^--- done (AFAIK)(so... test it)
