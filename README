PREFACE (specific to this antiX-maintained version of SLiM)

    As of Jan2018, among the known (known to skidoo) available
    potential "upstream" sources, none are well-suited to patching.
    Debian has added code supporting systemd-related stuffs into SLiM,
    has ramped-up the amount of code dedicated to PAM support,
    and is in the process of removing consolekit support.

    This antiX-maintained version should be regarded as a hard fork,
    with future changes cherry-picked from various sources.
    For now, the list of sources consulted as well as both the completed
    and prospective edits/changes are detailed in the TODO file.

    To preclude the need for marking/pinning packages, the declared version
    (within CMakeLists.txt and debian/changelog) is v1.4.1


INTRODUCTION
    SLiM (Simple Login Manager) is a graphical login manager (DisplayManager) for X11.
    It aims to be simple, fast, and independent from the various desktop environments.

    Features:
    - External (customizable) themes and configuration
    - PNG support (with alpha transparency) for panel
    - PNG / JPEG support for background images
    - XFT / freetype support
    - Double or single (GDM-style) inputbox support
    - CMake build procedure

INSTALLATION
    see the INSTALL file (for generic, not antiX, instructions)

USAGE
    To launch slim, execute (run) the slim binary,
    followed by the -d option if you want it to run as a daemon in the background (recommended)

    Enter username and password to login. The ~/.xinitrc file is executed by default,
    so ensure your home directory contains a working  .xinitrc file

    Special username strings can be entered to initiate commands (configurable, via the config file):
    - console: starts console-based login
    - exit: exits SLiM
    - halt: halts the system
    - reboot: reboots the system

    Pressing the F11 key executes a user-specified command (see the configuration file);
    the default command is to take a screenshot (using scrot, which is pre-installed in antiX)

CONFIGURATION
    /etc/slim.conf is the SLiM configuration file.
    Options are explained via inline comments within the file itself
    ( see also: /usr/share/doc/slim/SLIM_OPTIONS.txt )
    For reference (or rollback), a copy of the as-shipped conf file is installed to
    /usr/share/doc/slim/slim.conf.antix_orig

THEMES
