PREFACE (specific to this antiX-maintained version of SLiM)

    As of Jan2018, among the known (known to skidoo) available
    potential "upstream" sources, none are well-suited to patching.
    Debian has added code supporting systemd-related stuffs into SLiM,
    has ramped-up the amount of code dedicated to PAM support,
    and is in the process of removing consolekit support.

    This antiX-maintained version should be regarded as a hard fork,
    with future changes cherry-picked from various sources.
    For now, the list of sources consulted as well as both the completed
    and prospective edits/changes are detailed in the  doc/TODO  file.

    To preclude the need for marking/pinning packages on antiX systems,
    the declared version (within CMakeLists.txt and debian/changelog) is currently "v1.4.2"


INTRODUCTION
    SLiM (Simple Login Manager) is a graphical login manager (DisplayManager) for X11.
    It aims to be simple, fast, and independent from the various desktop environments.

    Features:
    - supports customizable themes and provides a range of configuration options
    - option to display a fixed-choice, or random theme each time
    - panel provides PNG support (with alpha transparency)
    - remembers last session (sessionname) used; user can press F1 to cycle thru available xsession
    - option to specify default_user and autologin
    - PNG / JPEG support for background images
    - supports use of freetype and XFT fonts
    - configurable inputbox presentation: dual, or single (GDM-style)
    - CMake build procedure

INSTALLATION
    for generic instructions (systems other than antiX),
    refer to the  doc/INSTALL  file within this source package


USAGE
    To launch slim, execute (run) the slim binary,
    followed by the -d option if you want it to run as a daemon (recommended)
    (If not run as a daemon, the user is returned to console upon session logout.)

    While the SLiM login screen is displayed:

	   Pressing "F1" toggles (cycles   choose   installed / available desktop sessions

       Enter username and password to login. The ~/.xinitrc file is executed by default,
       so ensure your home directory contains a working  .xinitrc file

       Special username strings can be entered to initiate commands (configurable, via slim.conf file):
       - console: starts console-based login
       - exit: exits SLiM
       - halt: halts the system
       - reboot: reboots the system

       Pressing the F11 key executes a user-specified command (see the configuration file);
       the default command is to take a screenshot (using scrot, which is pre-installed in antiX)

CONFIGURATION
    /etc/slim.conf is the SLiM configuration file.
    Options are explained via inline comments within the file itself
    ( see also:  /usr/share/doc/slim/SLIM_OPTIONS.txt )
    On antiX systems, a copy of the as-shipped conf file is also installed to
    /usr/share/doc/slim/slim.conf.antix_orig (for reference, or rollback)
