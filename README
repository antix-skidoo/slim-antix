PREFACE (specific to this antiX-maintained version of SLiM)

    As of Jan2018, among the known (known to skidoo) available
    potential "upstream" sources, none are well-suited to patching.
    Debian has added into SLiM code supporting systemd-related stuffs,
    has ramped-up the amount of code dedicated to PAM support,
    and is in the process of removing consolekit support.
    
    This antiX-maintained version should be regarded as a hard fork,
    with future changes cherry-picked from various sources.
    For now, the list of source consulted as well as both the completed
    and prospective edits/changes are detailed in TODO
    
    In order to preclude the need for marking/pinning packages,
    the declared version (within CMakeLists.txt and debian/ChangeLog) is v1.4.1


INTRODUCTION
    SLiM (Simple Login Manager) is a graphical login manager for X11.
    It aims to be simple, fast and independent from the various
    desktop environments.
    SLiM is based on latest stable release of Login.app by Per Lid√©n.

    Features:
    - External themes and configuration
    - PNG support with alpha transparency for panel
    - PNG / JPEG support for backgrounds
    - XFT / freetype support
    - Double or single (GDM-style) inputbox support
    - CMake build procedure

INSTALLATION
    see the INSTALL file
    
USAGE

    To launch slim, execute run the slim binary,
    followed by the -d option if you want it to
    run as a daemon in the background (reccommended)
    
    enter username and password to login. The ~/.xinitrc
    file is executed by default, so be sure to have a working
    .xinitrc file in your home.
    
    Special usernames (commands configurable in the config file):
    - console: start console login
    - exit: exit SLiM
    - halt: halt the system
    - reboot: reboot the system
    
    pressing the F11 key executes a user-specified
    command (see the configuration file); the default command
    is to take a screenshot (using scrot, which is pre-installed in antiX)
    
CONFIGURATION
    /usr/etc/slim.conf is the main configuration file.
    Options are explained via inline comments within the file itself
